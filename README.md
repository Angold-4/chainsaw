#  chainsaw: A Codeforces Commandline Tool

chainsaw is a small and faster drop-in replacement for your copy and paste while attending Codeforces contests. chainsaw is created for increasing 
competitive programmer productivity by reducing run sample test time especially in real-time contests and the sites kind of lagging due to the traffic.

## Why does the speed matter?

No matter you are a competitive programmer or a hobby coder, while attending a contest, you always want things to be as convenient as possible.
A contest consists of three phases. In the first phase, you create all your `*.cpp` or any other language file. In the second phase, you write algorithms to solve that specific problem.
In the third phase, you compile your program and run all sample tests from website to check whether your code is correct.

The first phase and third phase are just repetitive copy and paste work, but it will waste a lot of time if you just do it by your self, and a little bit annoying. chainsaw can make it automatically, and much faster, saving your time and keeping you from being distracted while copy the test file from website and re-compile your program and check whether it is correct. The difference is most noticeable when you are in rapid fix/debug-edit-recompile cycles.

## Install

chainsaw is written in C++17, so if you want to install chainsaw on your machine. you need a very recent version of GCC or Clang. I'm using
